<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Junior Research Assistant at [Department of Electronic Engineering](https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/en-gb/), [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html), advised by [Prof. Hongliang Ren](https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/en-gb/people/academic-staff/professors/prof-ren-hongliang). I collaborate closely with [Long Bai](https://longbai-cuhk.github.io/) at our [MEDICAL MECHATRONICS Lab](http://www.labren.org/mm/lab/). From this August, I will be a Ph.D. student for the CUHK-HUAWEI Joint PhD Program. Previously, I received the M. Sc. degree in Department of Electronic Engineering from The Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2023, advised by Prof. Hongliang Ren. I also received my Bachelor degree in Automation at [College of Mechatronics and Engineering](https://cmce.szu.edu.cn/), [Shenzhen University](https://www.szu.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Xiaopin Zhong](https://cmce.szu.edu.cn/info/1429/3795.htm).

My research interests include computer vision and its applications in medical image analysis and surgical robotic perception. I recently work on large vision-language models and downstream surgical robot control.
